KH Repo for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo was created to satisfy the requirements for completing the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. The goal of the project is to prepare two tidy datasets that can be used for later analysis. The raw data used for the project comes from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository's [Human Activity Recognition Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) and was downloaded from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

The two tidy datasets (humActRecogTidy.csv and humActRecogTidyGrouped.csv) generated for the project can be found in this repo. Users can get started on reproducing these datasets by first downloading the raw data from the above link and running the R script run_analysis.R. This script will generate and export two tidy datasets as .csv files stored in a directory titled "data" (which will be created as a sub-directory of your R working directory if said directory does not exist). A codebook (Codebook.md) describing the variables in the tidy datasets, as well as the transformations applied to the raw data to obtain said datasets, is also available in this repo for reference.

Happy Coding!
